Q and A

How do I enter dates I can play?
Send a text(iMessage or SMS) to Ron that starts with the magic phrase "Updatemyplay", followed by your name (not "I") and something like can play or is available and dates.
Examples:
Updatemyplay Sue can play 6/5, 6/8, 6/9
Updatemyplay Jack is available 6/6

How do I enter dates I can't play?
Updatemyplay Harry can't play 6/5, 6/10, 6/11
Updatemyplay Sally cannot play 6/12

How do I change something already in the table?
Just send the opposite in the same way. To change Jack can play 6/6:
Updatemyplay Jack can't play 6/6
Updatemyplay Sally can play 6/12

Where is the table?
For iphone users:
I'm sharing a folder, "ipub", on Apple's icloud, and the table is a web page in that folder.   When you get a link from me, try pinning it in messages or maybe copy/paste it somewhere.
For Android users:
There's a MS OneDrive shared folder, "pub", that has the HTML file. Just use the link I send you to open the folder.

//// That's all you need to know to use this to share and see folks' availability. ////

Additional information:

What if I can only play in the afternoon?
Try this:
Updatemyplay Sally(PM) can play 6/7
or
Updatemyplay Jack(after 3) is available 6/2, 6/4
Just put short remark in parentheses.


When will my updates show up?
I'll be experimenting with update frequency. Something like immediately when new information comes in and the table hasn't been updated in X minutes/hours, X TBD.

Can I enter dates for another person?
Yes, the program doesn't know anything about who sent the text. Which means you can be nasty and erase people. Don't.

Is it true that AI is doing all the work and you're just taking credit?
Yes.

Ron
